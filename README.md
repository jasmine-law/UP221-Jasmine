# UP221-Jasmine

## About me
My name is Jasmine Law *(she/her/hers)* and I'm a first year MURP student with a concentration in Transportation Policy and Planning!
Before I entered the MURP program, I graduated from UCSD with a degree in Environmental Systems and worked for a few years on Safe Routes to Schools Programs in the Bay Area.

In my free time, I like to go bouldering, crochet, play video games, and spend time with my cats (who may appear on screen during class).

## Course Description
I'm taking this course because there's tons of data in urban planning, and I want to be able to understand it all.

## Project Ideas (I'll write in more later!)
1. I'd be interested in measuring public engagement across different neighborhoods or different major cities. It would also be interesting to track how engagement may be changing as more cities implement more hybrid public meetings, language interpretation, and more in-person outreach at community events.
